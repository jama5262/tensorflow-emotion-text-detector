This repo contains four branches which are the following

1. [`master`](https://github.com/jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector) branch - Contains the `docker-compose.yml` file. This is used to start the two containers from the tensorflow-serving and flask server docker image and to also allow communication between them. See the Installation and Usage section on how to get started

```
version: "3"

services: 
  tf-model:
    image: jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector
    ports: 
     - 8501:8501
  flask-server:
    image: jama5262/flask-tensorflow-emotion-text-detector
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    depends_on: 
      - tf-model
```

2. [`colab-notebook`](https://github.com/jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector/tree/colab-notebook) branch - This contains the notebook used to `create` and `export` the tensorflow estimator model

3. [`flask-server`](https://github.com/jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector/tree/flask-server) branch - Contains the flask server-side that hosts the react build files and the predict emotion endpoint.

4. [`react-client`](https://github.com/jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector/tree/react-client) branch - And this branch contains the react client-side UI

## Installation

### Cloning
Clone this repo from the `master` branch to your local machine using `https://github.com/jama5262/tensorflow-emotion-text-detector.git`

After cloning, `cd` into the project

Great the project has been setup üëç

## Usage

_**Before you start using, please check that the ports `5000` and `8501` are not in use**_

Port `5000` is used by flask server and port `8501` is used by tensorflow serving

To start using it locally, run the following `docker` command
```
docker-compose up
```

After that check your http://localhost:5000
